Multi-player event recognition is a challenging task, particularly in sports
where many players are active in the scene but only a small subset
contribute to the event. In this paper, we propose a model which learns to
detect events in basketball videos while automatically "attending" to the
players responsible for the events,
without being explicitly told who/ where those players are.
In particular, we detect players in videos and learn
time-varying attention weights to combine their features at each time-instant.
The attended features are then classified with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model.  
We evaluate our model on a new basketball dataset comprised of 257
basketball games with 14K event annotations corresponding to 11
event classes.  Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both event
classification  and  detection on this new dataset. Additionally,  the
attention mechanism is able to localize the relevant players.
