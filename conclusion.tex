\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced a new attention based model for event classification and
detection in multi-person videos. Apart from recognizing the event, our model
can identify the key people responsible for the event without being explicitly
trained with such annotations. Our method can generalize to any
multi-person setting. However, for the purpose of this paper we introduced a
new dataset of basketball videos with dense event annotations and compared our
performance with state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.  We also evaluated
the ability of our model to recognize the ``shooter" in each of the events with
visualizations of the spatial locations attended by our model.
